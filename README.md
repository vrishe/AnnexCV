AnnexCV
=======

Some helpful OpenCV framework functionality-based extensions.
It does include:
  - SUSAN edge/corner detector with pre-filtering mechanism, that is described here: http://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~steve/susan/susan/susan.html;
  - Image illumination normalization method that is provided by X. Tan and B. Triggs in their "Enhanced Local Texture Feature Sets for Face Recognition Under Difficult Lighting Conditions";
  - Other supplementary functions. 

Tips:
OpenCV should have an Environment Variable named OPENCV_DIR which should reference to opencv library root 
(That means this: [your/opencv/root]/opencv-x.x.x, where x.x.x - is for opencv particular version for the case if you have multiple ones).
